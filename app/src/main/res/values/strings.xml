    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Maja.
        \n\nI love programming, travelling and reading.
        \n\nI have recently completed a Java Programming Bootcamp and am now developing my skills through
        different online courses and private projects. My favourite programming languages are Java and Kotlin.
        \n\nI have visited several European countries, as well as the United States of America. I
        liked Vienna, Zurich, New York, Paris, Dublin and Amsterdam the most. My next destination is
        Novi Sad, Serbia and Southeast Asia (Vietnam).
        \n\nI have been a member of the library since I was 4, and I enjoy reading novels, popular
        psychology and sociology. My favourite books are the Harry Potter series.</string>
